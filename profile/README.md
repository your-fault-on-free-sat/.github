The story of *Your Fault* (2024) begins with **Rohit Mehra** (played by [actor name from SERP]), a man in his early thirties, who is struggling to overcome the mistakes he made in his youth. Once a promising young professional with a bright future, Rohit’s life took a downturn after a series of poor decisions that led to estrangement from his family and friends. He now finds himself trapped in a cycle of regret and self-doubt.

As the film opens, Rohit is living a quiet and unfulfilling life in a small apartment, far away from the success he once dreamed of. He works at a mediocre job and spends most of his time reflecting on his past mistakes. However, an unexpected encounter with **Nina Kapoor** (played by [actor name from SERP]), a counselor who specializes in personal growth and therapy, becomes the turning point in Rohit’s life. Nina encourages him to confront his past and take responsibility for the choices he made, but also to forgive himself and work towards being a better person.
